# Yelp Restaurant Recommendation System

#### Problem Statement

#### Data Description 
The data used in this project is part of theÂ Yelp Dataset Challenge (Round 12) downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset. The dataset consists of a set of JSON files that include business information, reviews, tips (shorter reviews), user information and check-ins. 
NOTE: The dataset keeps changing every year.
 
The data consists of six sub datasets which describes the data with a brief information.

The size of the Data is 6.84 Gb including the sub files:
1. Business Dataset (139 MB)
2. Check-In Dataset (50.3 MB)
3. Photo Dataset (34.9 MB)
4. Review Dataset (4.39 GB) 
5. Tips Dataset (203 MB)
6. Users Dataset (2.03 GB)

* Business objects list name, location, opening hours, category, average star rating, the number of reviews about the business and a series of attributes like noise level or reservations policy.
* Review objects list a star rating, the review text, the review date, and the number of votes that the review has received.

In this project, we have focused on these two types of objects.
